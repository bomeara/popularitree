Description: Often you want to show a reduced summary tree. Taxa chosen should span all the tree (for example, a tree of mammals should not have just primates) but also be recognizable groups to your audience. This lets you select a final tree size you want, criteria you want to use, and finds the tree that maximizes the criteria.
